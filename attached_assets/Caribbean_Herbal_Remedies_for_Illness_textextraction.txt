cooling mechanism—sweating.

The Master
Mash (below)
🚨 The Emergency "Master Mash" Recipe
When the sickness is aggressive, eat this alongside your tea every 4-6 hours:
1. Crush 3 cloves of Garlic and 1 thin slice of Red Onion.
2. Mix with 1 tablespoon of Raw Local Honey.
3. Add a pinch of Black Pepper (to activate the sulfur compounds).
4. Swallow a teaspoonful and follow immediately with a warm herbal infusion.
The Three Golden Rules of the Toolkit
1. The Mucus Rule: If it's white (dairy, flour, sugar), put it away. These ingredients "glue"
the sickness to your body.
2. The Heat Rule: Drink your teas as hot as comfortably possible to help the "sweat"
process.
3. The Rest Rule: These herbs work by redirecting your body's energy to your immune
system. If you drink the tea but stay on your feet/phone, you cut the effectiveness in half.
